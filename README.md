# Tic-Tac-Toe-Minimax

This project aims to be an introduction into the minimax algorithm, implementing a "computer player" that recursively calculates the best next move in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
The possible depth of a Tic-Tac-Toe game is relatively low, so python is fast enough to calculate the outcomes.
In an extension to this project, I would implement the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning using the game connect-four. Since there are many more outcomes in this game, I would write this in C++ to significantly reduce the run-time.
